AStar:
 - Rewrite pathfinding algorithm
 - Provide several versions: greedy and not. Compare times

Collisions:
 + Rewrite collision of circle and line (and of arc and line)

Physics:
 - Rewrite rear gear
 + Rewrite inertia (now it's directed same direction as car, but it shouldn't)

Enviroment:
 - Add ability to move/change/add/delete obstacles and save 'em to JSON

Graph building:
 - Check for intersection between outlines of objects
 - Rewrite outline for chain (polyline) colliders - because of wrong order ot generates false edges
 - Partial update of graph (cause there is no point in updating between static objects)

Path:
 - Make algorithm aware of inertia
 - Additional check, whether car is on right distance from arc center
 - Wrong direction of drawed arcs
 + Add max speed grpah to speed graph
 + Check speed controlling algorithm

Obstacle finding:
 ~ Write obstacle finding algorithm

Controls:
 - Rewrite controls
